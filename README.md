# **Task Management API with Java (Spring Boot, Hibernate, Liquibase, and Gradle)**

This project demonstrates the use of **Java** with **Spring Boot**, **Hibernate**, **Liquibase**, and **Gradle** to build a robust **Task Management API**. The backend handles user management, task management, database versioning, and build automation.

A **React** front-end is included to interact with the API.

## **Features**

### **Backend (API)**
1. **Spring Boot** for creating a RESTful API.
2. **Hibernate** for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), simplifying database interactions.
3. **Liquibase** for database schema versioning and migrations.
4. **Gradle** for build automation and dependency management.

#### **Core Functionality**
- **Task Management**: Create, read, update, and delete tasks, and assign them to users.

### **Frontend (React UI)**
- A simple **React app** is included to interact with the backend API.
